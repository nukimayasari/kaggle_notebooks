By evaluating and refining these models, we seek to enhance our understanding of the predictive power of these variables and improve our ability to estimate IQ scores from developmental and environmental data.\n\n**The analysis will be structured as follows:**\n\n* **Data Description**: Overview of the datasets, including key statistics and data cards for each variable.\n* **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualization and interpretation of relationships between IQ scores and other factors.\n* **Machine Learning Models**: Development and evaluation of predictive models to assess the impact of various factors on IQ scores.\n* **Conclusion**: Summary of findings and insights, along with recommendations for future research or applications.\n\nBy the end of this notebook, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how different factors relate to children's IQ and to build robust predictive models to aid in future analyses.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Project Overview**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this notebook, I am working with two distinct datasets to explore, analyze, and draw meaningful insights into how IQ scores in children are related to various factors surrounding them.

Maternal IQ exhibited a moderate positive correlation with child IQ, while paternal IQ showed a weaker, less pronounced correlation.\n\n**Model Performance**: We evaluated several models to predict IQ scores. The XGBRegressor with 1000 estimators and a learning rate of 0.05 achieved the lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.9731 on a small dataset. Cross-validation with this model revealed an average MAE of 2.8922, indicating robust performance. This model significantly outperformed the baseline model with an MAE of 4.1339, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing the relationship between the features and child IQ.\n\n# **Dataset 2: Child and Mother IQ Analysis**\n\nFor the child and mother IQ dataset, we examined the impact of maternal education and age on child IQ scores:\n\n**Maternal Education**: The analysis of average child IQ scores by maternal education level revealed a general trend where higher maternal education levels correlated with higher child IQ scores. This trend was visually confirmed by both the scatter plots and the line chart showing an increasing average IQ with higher education levels, though with some fluctuations.\n\n**Maternal Age**: The relationship between maternal age at childbirth and child IQ was explored through scatter plots and a color-coded regression analysis. The results indicated varying patterns of IQ scores with maternal age, suggesting that both younger and older maternal ages had specific impacts on child IQ. The average IQ scores by maternal age showed some variability, with certain ages correlating with higher average IQ scores.\n\n**Model Performance**: For predicting child IQ based on the factors in this dataset, the XGBRegressor model with n_estimators=200 and learning_rate=0.02 yielded an MAE of 15.7736 on the validation set. However, cross-validation results showed an average MAE of 16.8958, suggesting that the model performed slightly better on the validation set compared to the cross-validation folds. This indicates potential overfitting or variability in model performance across different data subsets.\n\n# **Overall Summary**\n\nIn summary, the analysis demonstrated that both parental factors and maternal education significantly influence child IQ. The **XGBRegressor** models showed **promising performance**, with adjustments needed to fine-tune the models and enhance their generalizability. Future work should focus on further refining the models, exploring additional features, and conducting more in-depth analyses to confirm these findings and improve prediction accuracy.","metadata":{}}]}
